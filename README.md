## 👨‍💻 Who am I?
Hi! I'm **Galih** – a curious **Blockchain Enthusiast** and an aspiring **Front End Developer**. While I'm still learning the ins and outs of **coding** and exploring the world of **Solidity**, I’m always eager to improve and discover new technologies. The world of blockchain fascinates me, and I’m on a journey to learn how it can reshape the future!

I’m currently learning:
- 🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- 🛠️ Blockchain ecosystems like **Kommunitas** and **Scroll**
- 💻 How to build dApps and smart contracts (still getting the hang of it!)
