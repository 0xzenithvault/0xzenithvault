## 👨‍💻 Who am I?
Hi! I'm **Galih** – a curious **Blockchain Enthusiast** and an aspiring **Front End Developer**. While I'm still learning the ins and outs of **coding** and exploring the world of **Solidity**, I’m always eager to improve and discover new technologies. The world of blockchain fascinates me, and I’m on a journey to learn how it can reshape the future!

I’m currently learning:
- 🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- 🛠️ Blockchain ecosystems like **Kommunitas** and **Scroll**
- 💻 How to build dApps and smart contracts (still getting the hang of it!)

---

## 🌍 What Drives Me
Blockchain is more than just a buzzword – it's a vision of a transparent, secure, and decentralized future. I might be at the beginning of my learning journey, but the excitement keeps me going as I dive deeper into coding and blockchain.

While I’m still improving my skills, I believe that coding is a process of constant growth. Every bug I fix (or break) is a step forward in becoming a better developer!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (still learning the ropes)
- **Frameworks**: React, Bootstrap
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VSCode, MetaMask (definitely getting better!)
- **Blockchain Platforms**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Scroll (exploring these with curiosity)
